-US policy frames DPRK as irrational, cause of all problems, eeeeeeevil
-"The rhetoric of rogue states is indicative of how USforeign policy continues to be driven by dualistic and militaristic Cold Warthinking patterns. The ‘Evil Empire’ may be gone; not so the underlying needto define safety and security with reference to an external threat that must bewarded off at any cost"
-nicholas eberstadt (fundamental policy document, according to Smith) claims instability in NE asia ALL DPRK's fault
-during Bush administration, preemptive strike policy against "rogue states" reinforced implicit/explicit threat posed by US to DPRK
	-US policy obscures the result of this by blaming DPRK for problems
-case study: foreign policy during the 1994 crisis by the US framed DPRK as rogue state, discouraged mutual cooperation, fostered recalcitrance
-in 1998 the Perry Report comes out, suggesting a still-aggressive but more "integrated" policy (read this report later if available?) "Tn this respect the Perry Report signified a remarkable departure fromthe US position of viewing rogue states as inherently evil, irrational andincapable of compromising."
-US "axis of evil" speech, publication of nuclear strategy explicitly mentioning possible first-use of nukes against rogue states, including DPRK
-"Severalscholars, most notably Bruce Cumings and Hazel Smith, have for years drawnattention to Washington’s inability to see North Korea as anything but a dangerousand unpredictable rogue state"
-simultaneous propagation of "we want to have discussion! confidence-building! dialogue!" but also "DPRK is evil! all military options are still on the table!"
-Re: the Kelly negotiations in 2002: "‘These were not negotiations,’ stressed one of them. ‘Kelly immediately startedwith accusations." (Cited in Henrik Bork, ‘Annäherungen auf Umwegen’, Süddeutsche Zeitung, 11 Jan. 2003, p. 2. Author’stranslation., via this article)

-"This ahistoricity went hand in hand with assertions that would fail a freshman logic class. North Korea was the greatest security threat in the world, according to the leaders of our foreign policy, and simultaneously on the verge of collapse. How could it be ten feet tall and about to devour the South, with a basket-case economy? A huge military threat and a demolished economy, all led by a nut case?" (re: US rhetoric in the 90s)
-factions within US military wanted nuclear solution to DPRK starting in the 50s
	-chairman of joint chiefs, admiral radford, wnted to futz with armistice because it wouldn't allow putting nukes on the peninsula (in the 50s)
-during the beginning of the 1993 crisis (NPT withdraw threatened), US rhetoric painted DPRK as "America's greatest security threat", 
-1993 crisis kicked off by resumption of US-ROK joint war games ("Team Spirit")


"Bad, mad, sad, or rational actor? Why the 'securitization' paradigm makes for poor policy analysis of north Korea" Hazel Smith, International Affairs, Vol 76 Issue 3, Dec 2002

http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-2346.00154/pdf

-characterizes the split view of DPRK as "bad" ("motivated by malevolence and belligerence and its leadership's foreign and domestic policies can be ascribed to evil intent. Internationally, north Korea is ready to make war upon its neighbours, perhaps even to attack the United States itself and, in pursuit of these offensive aims, is constantly engaged in a furtive arms buildup."; this is where "rogue state" language comes from; the framing of the DPRK's military readiness as "overwhelming" w/r/t ROK's without taking into account material differences between themselves and the South) and "mad" (essentially the same as "bad" with the nuance of also assuming an irrational actor; "unknowable, unpredictable and dangerous because of the underlying presumed ill intent of its leadership."; some amount of mystification - claims that the DPRK is unknowABLE because it frequently does not follow conventional-wisdom diplomatic decisionmaking/adhere to common diplomatic norms)
-securitization paradigm followed by US and other foreign nations engaging with DPRK is inflexible; bad at accounting for new/changing conditions; only admits the possibility that, fundamentally, either nothing can be done re: DPRK or nothing SHOULD be done.

"Disarming Strangers: Nuclear Diplomacy with North Korea"

-Discussion of the first nuclear crisis (NPT leaving, Agreed fmwkr signing - first two cycles I think?)
	"Instead of engaging in diplomatic give-and-take, however, Washington insisted that Pyongyang comply fully with the Nonproliferation Treaty as a precondition for negotiations and threatened it with economic sanctions, even air strikes, if it did not. The United States drew attention to North Korea's nuclear past and its nuclear potential and ignored its nuclear self-restraint."
	"Holding out the promise of talks as a reward for good behavior deprived the United States of a way to resolve its nuclear differences with North Korea. From 1988 until late 1993,even when the United States entered into talks, it did not negotiate"
	"Carter, backed by a handful of nongovernmental organizations, overturned American policy by undercutting the sanctions strategy and revived chances for a diplomatic deal. Yet his efforts were widely disparaged, even by some top officials of the Clinton administration...In the face of severe criticism, with little support from the foreign policy establisment, the administration eventually got North Korea to agree to halt and roll back its nuclear arms programs..."
	"'The arguments in Washington were largely projections by Americans with strong views about how they thought it would react,' one highly placed Clinton administration official recalls."
	"Senior officials in the Bush and the Clinton Administrations were themselves skeptical that diplomacy could succeed. Given the doubt and hostility in Congress and in the foreign policy establishment, both administrations were loath to try. Until the spring of 1993, they sought to avoid talks. When they did negotiate, they shied away from tabling specific offers. When they did make proposals, they couched concessions in threats. When they made promises, they did not always keep them."
	"Most senior officials did not try to discern North Korea's motives, difficult as that may have been, or to design probes of its intentions. Doubtful about striking a nuclear deal and knowing that other influential Americans thought likewise, top officials in both administrations were attentive to domestic politics and closed-minded about what North Korea was saying and doing. That led to a number of rude surprises. It very nearly led to war."
	RE: Bush I
		National Security Advisor, CIA Director, Secretaries of State and Defense - believed there was no diplomatic solution
		"No country has been the target of more American nuclear threats than North Korea - at least seven since 1945"


U.S.-North Korean Relations under the Bush Administration: From "Slow Go" to "No Go" 
Sebastian Harnisch, Asian Survey, Vol. 42, No. 6 (November/December 2002), pp. 856-882
http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.mit.edu/stable/pdf/10.1525/as.2002.42.6.856.pdf?acceptTC=true
-Republican voices in Congress helped push demands by the US higher and higher at the end of the Clinton administration, and "the trend to raise the bar to build a domestic consensus has accelerated during the Bush administration because of heavy bureaucratic infighting"
-Rumsfeld rhetoric about the "axis of evil" suggests hostility (to the point of being plausible interpretable as We Will Preemptive Strike)
-problems within Bush II administration: DPRK targeted charm offensive on State Department, which worked, but was undermined by other parts of the administration
-Armitage report: in 1999, claiming US should try to do an integrated package deal "including conventional arms control and North-South reconciliation" and only preemptively aggress if that didn't work...but Armitage and Powell in State were spoken over by Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz in the DoD
-mid-2001 report concludes, essentially, with "Overall, the administration tried to present a comprehensive package deal as a “take-it-or-leave-it” negotiating position to the North Koreans."
-"In early July, during the hearings for the 2002 Defense Appropriations Bill, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz emphasized that U.S. troops in South Korea were targets of North Korean short-range missiles, and that the U.S. homeland was the target of Pyongyang’s long-range missile program."
-"In sum, since taking office the Bush administration position vis-a-vis Pyongyang had toughened considerably, even before solid intelligence occurred that Pyongyang was pursuing a secret nuclear weapons program, because of the need to build a domestic consensus among moderate and hardline critics of North Korea within the administration and in Congress"



"Perry Report" http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB87/nk20.pdf
"Review of United States Policy Towards North Korea: Findings and Recommendations" by Dr. William J. Perry, Special Advisor to the President and the Secretary of State, October 1999.
-Agreed Framework was good, but the world has changed since it was implemented (KIS --> KJI, DPRK economy in the shitter, DPRK has advanced its missile tech, ROK has gotten more friendly with north, Japan has gotten less friendly)
-control of nuclear proliferation in the region k2 regional security of all kinds, b/c arms race and shit
-we shouldn't undermine the agreed framework, because it has WORKED
Key findings:
	-DPRK w/ nukes is Bad News - we REALLY don't want that
	-we would win a korean war, but it'd suck
	-we have to be prepared to normalize diplomatic relations if it'll get them to give up nukes
	-yongbyon is the easiest path to nukes - so we need to keep the agreed framework, since that is the thing that has worked to keep it frozen
	-need to coordinate w/ROK and Japan
	-"a successful US policy will require steadiness and persistence even in the face of provocations"
Policy options rejected:
	-squo deterrence/limited engagement: it's worked previously but it's not sustainable/would collapse in crisis or would lose political support for the useful parts
	-undermining DPRK: would take a long time, might result in war, might be :( for citizens
	-reforming DPRK: hahahaha it's nice to want things
	-give DPRK $$$: that's BLACKMAIL!
Option suggested:
	-"two-path strategy"
	-"new, comprehensive, and integrated approach to our negotiations with the DPRK": want assurances re: nukes and missile testing, but reciprocally reduce threats to DPRK (normalize relations, decrease sanctions, etc.)
	-if that fails, "take firm but measured steps to persuade the DPRK" to do the thing, but also "act to contain the threat that we have been unable to eliminate through negotiation" - don't torch the agreed framework, but approve a different plan of action for contingencies that's punishing

A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO NORTH KOREA
Richard Armitage 
Institute for National Strategic Studies, National Defense University 
March 1999
http://nautilus.org/publications/books/dprkbb/uspolicy/dprk-briefing-book-a-comprehensive-approach-to-north-korea/

-agreed framework was necessary but insufficient
-policymakers made the assumption that it would halt the nuclear program and hasten reconciliation (and avoid "hard landing" collapse), but that isn't true - DPRK is still going strong
-DPRK has responded to the sunshine policy economically/culturally, but seems uninterested in political reconciliation
-"The notion that buying time works in our favor is increasingly dubious. A growing body of evidence suggests that it is North Korea that is buying time—to consolidate the regime, continue its nuclear weapons program, and build and sell two new generations of missiles"
-need to unify nuclear and other diplomatic tracks into a single strategy
-"Only by fairly testing Pyongyang’s intentions through diplomacy can we validate policy assumptions. If a diplomatic solution is not possible, it is to our advantage to discover this sooner rather than later in order to best protect our security interests."
-should engage in military posturing (to show stick is not just words) but should offer legitimate out in the form of diplomatic agreements
-US should stop being reactive, "Washington should table an offer that meets Pyongyang’s legitimate economic, security, and political concerns."
-"For the United States and its allies, the package as a whole means that we are prepared—if Pyongyang meets our concerns—to accept North Korea as a legitimate actor, up to and including full normalization of relations."
-"Assurances could run the gamut from a pledge of nonaggression to a commitment to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of North Korea. Our goal should be to foster an environment making it as easy as possible for Pyongyang to choose reform."
-"The virtue of this initiative is that it will test North Korea’s intentions, discover whether diplomacy holds any real possibility of yielding positive results, and, in the process, restore U.S. leadership."

"North Korea: U.S. Relations, Nuclear Diplomacy, and Internal Situation"
Congressional Research Service, Emma Chanlett-Avery and Ian E. Rinehart
January 4, 2013 

-response to 2012 satellite launch: closing off of many initiatives from leap day agreement
-under Bush, focus shifted from bilateral to multilateral
	-six-party talks started in 2003
-"In his presidential campaign and inaugural address, President Obama indicated a willingness to engage with “rogue” governments."
-"strategic patience" perspective - attempting to maintain pressure while keeping lines of diplomacy open, stopping short of all-or-nothing demands as preconditions as per predecessor
-strong focus on nonproliferation in obama administration (unlike bush, see huntley)
-in 2011-12, enormous amounts of coordination of policy with ROK and Japan - this plus military maneuvers with ROK ties US-ROK positions heavily together
-US pressure on UNSC to increase potency of sanctions, running up against policy agenda with China

'Strategic Patience' With North Korea Gets You Nowhere
Michael Green, Jan 7 2016. Foreign Policy.
-Obama promised dialogue, had to do sanctions but then "strategic patience" happened
-Bush Administration was full of arguments but the six-party talks happened
	-and then tried to negotiate from a position of strength (banco delta asia) but it fell flat
-obama has put DPRK more on the back burner
-priority has been placed heavily on international action - security council and coalition-building
