-US policy frames DPRK as irrational, cause of all problems, eeeeeeevil
-"The rhetoric of rogue states is indicative of how USforeign policy continues to be driven by dualistic and militaristic Cold Warthinking patterns. The ‘Evil Empire’ may be gone; not so the underlying needto define safety and security with reference to an external threat that must bewarded off at any cost"
-during Bush administration, preemptive strike policy against "rogue states" reinforced implicit/explicit threat posed by US to DPRK
	-US policy obscures the result of this by blaming DPRK for problems
-case study: foreign policy during the 1994 crisis by the US framed DPRK as rogue state, discouraged mutual cooperation, fostered recalcitrance
-in 1998 the Perry Report comes out, suggesting a still-aggressive but more "integrated" policy (read this report later if available?) "Tn this respect the Perry Report signified a remarkable departure fromthe US position of viewing rogue states as inherently evil, irrational andincapable of compromising."
-US "axis of evil" speech, publication of nuclear strategy explicitly mentioning possible first-use of nukes against rogue states, including DPRK
-"Severalscholars, most notably Bruce Cumings and Hazel Smith, have for years drawnattention to Washington’s inability to see North Korea as anything but a dangerousand unpredictable rogue state"
-simultaneous propagation of "we want to have discussion! confidence-building! dialogue!" but also "DPRK is evil! all military options are still on the table!"
-Re: the Kelly negotiations in 2002: "‘These were not negotiations,’ stressed one of them. ‘Kelly immediately startedwith accusations." (Cited in Henrik Bork, ‘Annäherungen auf Umwegen’, Süddeutsche Zeitung, 11 Jan. 2003, p. 2. Author’stranslation., via this article)

-"This ahistoricity went hand in hand with assertions that would fail a freshman logic class. North Korea was the greatest security threat in the world, according to the leaders of our foreign policy, and simultaneously on the verge of collapse. How could it be ten feet tall and about to devour the South, with a basket-case economy? A huge military threat and a demolished economy, all led by a nut case?" (re: US rhetoric in the 90s)
-factions within US military wanted nuclear solution to DPRK starting in the 50s
	-chairman of joint chiefs, admiral radford, wnted to futz with armistice because it wouldn't allow putting nukes on the peninsula
-during the beginning of the 1993 crisis (NPT withdraw threatened), US rhetoric painted DPRK as "America's greatest security threat", 
-1993 crisis kicked off by resumption of US-ROK joint war games ("Team Spirit")


"Mad, Bad, Sad, or Rational Actor?"

-characterizes the split view of DPRK as "bad" ("motivatd by malevolence and belligerence and its leadership's foreign and domestic policies can be ascribed to evil intent. Internationally, north Korea is ready to make war upon its neighbours, perhaps even to attack the United States itself and, in pursuit of these offensive aims, is constantly engaged in a furtive arms buildup."; this is where "rogue state" language comes from; the framing of the DPRK's military readiness as "overwhelming" w/r/t ROK's without taking into account material differences between themselves and the South)
