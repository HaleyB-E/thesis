\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}

The specter of North Korean nuclear weapons has haunted the world since the early days of their nuclear reactor program in the 1960s \cite{pincus}. The international community, in particular the United States and South Korea, has always been adamant that a nuclear-armed North Korea is intolerable \cite{kerry,parksk}.

In the past, many believed that it was possible to achieve peaceful nuclear power for the DPRK without undue risk of weapon production – indeed, the 1994 Agreed Framework outlined a plan in which the United States would help North Korea develop a light-water reactor program \cite{agreed}. However, in recent years, even “proliferation-resistant” reactors like the LWRs have been deemed too great of a risk. In 2008, Lee Myung-bak ran his presidential campaign in South Korea on the founding principle that aid to the North should be dependent upon complete denuclearization \cite{snyder}. As of late 2015, the United States held the official position that resuming multilateral negotiations with the DPRK could not occur until denuclearization was guaranteed \cite{pennington}. North Korea, meanwhile, is insistent that it has the right to nuclear materials for both power plants and weaponry \cite{kcna}. 

A variety of methods have been tried to resolve this disagreement, from sanctions and aid restrictions to mandated denuclearization as a condition on resumption of treaty talks \cite{bajoria,davenport}. These methods have, at best, resulted in temporary disarmament or a partial rollback of the DPRK’s nuclear programs – but, in every case, the changes were only temporary and North Korea eventually returned to developing its nuclear weapons technology \cite{davenport,nti15,iaea09}.

When these methods have not succeeded, the UN and individual countries attempting to change the DPRK’s behavior have not systematically altered their approach \cite{davenport,nti15}. This indicates that negotiators believe the strategies themselves are valid, and grounded in a correct understanding of the DPRK’s nuclear situation. It is worthwhile to investigate whether this assumption is warranted.

\subsection{Objectives}

It is hypothesized that United States strategy in negotiating with North Korea is inconsistent with the technical facts of the North Korean nuclear program and past negotiating behavior. In other words, the cyclical nature of negotiations persists because negotiators base their positions on what they want to be true about the DPRK, rather than the facts of the situation. 

In order to test this hypothesis, data will be gleaned from analysis along three axes. Examination of the history of negotiations past will be combined with calculations on nuclear material stockpiles, weapons testing yields, and production capacity, as well as analysis of the rhetoric of press releases and offifical government statements. This combines qualitative and quantitative analysis in order to form the most complete picture of the DPRK's objectives and abilities possible.

A number of likely indicators of problems in American negotiation strategies can be predicted even before significant analysis has taken place. If North Korea's technical achievements are n line with or on trajectory to match its stated end goals for a nuclear arsenal and infrastructure, it seems unlikely to acquiesce to external pressures to reverse course. Also, if its rhetoric regarding denuclearization has been consistent across a wide variety of incentives and penalties, it is unlikely that variation in the terms of agreements along existing strategies will have a noticeable impact.

Meanwhile, there are also some indicators that American negotiation strategies hold the potential for success: if, for example, there have been previous agreements which, even if ultimately unsuccessful (as most if not all have eventually been), provided some sort of incremental improvement to the situation that lasted beyond the agreement's end. Also, if North Korea's technical capacity is still far from their desired endpoint and seems unlikely to reach it for many years, there is likely to be more room for productive negotiations.


\section{Background}

\subsection{Brief history of North Korean nuclear programs and negotiation attempts}

Throughout the 1950s, the DPRK and the USSR worked together to initiate the North Korean nuclear power program, beginning construction on the Yongbyon nuclear complex in the early 1960s \cite{nti15}. The country became party to limited IAEA regulations in the following decade for the 5 MWe reactor constructed at Yongbyon, but did not develop a complete safeguards agreement until some time after its entrance into the NPT in 1985 \cite{iaea09}. During the 80s, North Korea continued to expand the Yongbyon complex and look into LWR technology \cite{ntiYongbyon}.

Over the next several decades, the US and the DPRK signed a number of agreements under which assurances were made about the provision of LWRs to North Korea in exchange for regulations intended to limit risk of proliferation \cite{agreed, davenport}. However, KEDO – the organization created to implement these agreements by constructing the LWRs – faced significant challenges in terms of funding and political support, eventually functionally collapsing under the strain of disagreements between the DPRK and member states in 2006 \cite{kedohist}.

Simultaneously, the Yongbyon reactors that the KEDO project was intended to replace existed in a constant state of flux. The complex would be shut down pursuant to some new agreement, or the IAEA would be allowed to inspect portions of the site…but then, a few years later, the inspectors would be expelled and the facilities restarted again \cite{davenport,nti15,iaea09}.

As the reprocessing facility in Yongbyn operated in fits and starts, the DPRK gradually accumulated enough plutonium to produce nuclear weapons. An underground nuclear test in a DPRK facility in 2006 shocked and horrified the international community, which immediately responded with political admonishments and economic sanctions \cite{davenport}. To date, the DPRK has tested nuclear weapons twice more, along with a number of missile tests going back to 1998 \cite{orfall} and including launches in 2013 that culminated in the successful placement of a satellite into orbit \cite{davenport}. In addition to the nuclear tests, missile tests and rocket launches by the DPRK have been roundly criticized by the UN and many individual nations as attempts to develop effective nuclear missiles \cite{unApr12}.

\subsection{Current Political Status}

The North Korean nuclear program has been shut down and restarted a number of times, pursuant to various agreements made and then broken between the DPRK and a number of negotiating bodies \cite{bajoria,davenport}. The DPRK insists that its peaceful program should be allowed to continue \cite{kcna2}, while the US and South Korea claim that even this is unacceptable \cite{lee} – and demand complete commitment to denuclearization before any further negotiations can even begin.

This hard-line position is informed by fact – the Yongbyon reactor, nominally a peaceful source of power, did produce the material that has been used in the DPRK’s weapons program \cite{hecker}. But the stance has proven unhelpful in getting North Korea to the table for negotiations – they claim that it is their right as a sovereign nation to pursue both peaceful and military nuclear technology, and that maintaining this right is a necessary deterrent against foreign aggression \cite{kcna,kcna2}.

Each side, then, is demanding as a precondition for negotiation the very action that the other side refuses to even consider. It is perhaps unsurprising that this has not been effective. The result has been a cycle of behavior that has gone on for several decades: aggression and posturing on North Korea’s part is followed by sanctions and demands by other nations. Tension escalates until one side or the other begins to call for a diplomatic solution, which either ends in stalemate or produces results that only last for a short time before the agreements are broken again \cite{bajoria, davenport}.

\subsection{Previous Analysis of the Problem}

Many analyses of the nature of the politics surrounding DPRK nuclear diplomacy exist, and several have concluded that the problem is cyclic in nature \cite{blair,cfr,fisher,gause,habib,jun}. In general, the issue tends to be modeled as a series of cycles comprised of initial posturing, followed by aggression and escalation, and concluding with reconciliation that, depending on the analyst, may or may not be identified as sincere.

When these analyses are politically-motivated \cite{blair, cfr}, their logic tends to begin with the initial proposition that demand for complete denuclearization can someday be fulfilled, if only the correct combination of diplomacy and coercion can be found that will force the DPRK to comply. More academic treatments of the problem \cite{habib,jun} vary widely in their approach. Jun \cite{jun} identifies problems with past approaches, but seems to conclude that increased coordination between negotiating bodies and oversight of agreement implementation may yet salvage the denuclearization agenda. Meanwhile, Habib \cite{habib} claims that North Korea’s cyclic behavior is inevitable due to the nation’s military-first ethos. He further postulates that the nuclear program is a key part of this ethos, and thus that the DPRK will never sincerely agree to give it up.

Some rhetorical analysis of the North Korean nuclear issue does exist - in particular, one author has used automated frequency analysis to look at how references to countries and specific incidents correlates with references to nuclear programs in the DPRK’s official news agency's articles \cite{rich12,rich14}.

Through analysis of key words used in 15 years of KCNA articles, Rich uncovered a strong link between mentions of the United States and the DPRK’s nuclear program \cite{rich14}. Additionally, during a time period marked by international concern over North Korean military posturing and escalation, mentions of their nuclear program in KCNA articles were few and far between \cite{rich12}.

While this information does allow valuable conclusions to be drawn about the DPRK’s political positions, analysis of the \emph{tone} of KCNA articles and how this relates to the success or failure of negotiations they report on does not appear to exist. Neither, it seems, does any substantial analysis of United States rhetoric in press releases related to North Korean nuclear issues.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Historical Analysis}

Identifying the timing and relationship between various events - like sanctions, treaty negotiations, and missile tests - may illuminate consistency that will allow conclusions to be drawn about shifts in North Korean diplomatic posture. These correlations may indicate consistently successful (or unsuccessful) strategies on the part of North Korea, and they may provide insight as to the efficacy of favored political tools of those who would change the DPRK's behavior.

In keeping with established literature, analysis is patterned on the notion that US-DPRK relations are cyclic in nature. However, unlike much previous work, no attempt is made to fit individual behavior cycles to specific models. Instead, a broad analysis of instances of escalatory behavior is undertaken. Since this does not rely upon fitting all categories of events into a single three-to-five-step process (as is common within historical analysis of this problem \cite{fisher, jun}), it may be possible to identify correlations that have previously been missed.

Thus, behavioral cycles are here defined as any instigating event followed by a chain of other events which are direct responses to some action earlier in the chain. This allows classification into individual cycles for ease of pattern analysis, while avoiding the preconceptions built into a model with defined steps.

While even a model of this generality does exclude some relevant details (not every significant event in US-DPRK diplomatic history fits within an escalatory cycle), the purpose of this analysis is not a complete encapsulation of information about negotiations. Rather, the intention is to narrow a complicated multilateral diplomacy problem to a more tractable case, by forming a timeline of significant events that will serve as the backbone for subsequent analysis of technical and rhetorical changes.

\subsection{Technical Analysis}

A complete picture of the North Korean bargaining strategy cannot be formed without examining the technical data that exist on the DPRK's nuclear program. This general category encapsulates several subsections: production capacity, material stockpiles, and missile technology.

Production capacity analysis will draw initially from the technical details reported by analysts like Hecker\cite{hecker} who have observed North Korean enrichment and reprocessing facilities firsthand. Further analysis will draw preferentially from information provided by NGOs, with gaps filled in by information released by American and DPRK sources. (It is believed that government estimates are more likely to be biased in one direction or the other, so these sources will be avoided unless no other estimates exist)

Stockpile estimation will examine the amount of nuclear material shipped into the DPRK as part of various treaties and agreements over the years, as well as any estimates that exist on material that may have been smuggled into or out of the country. Production capacity analysis will be used to suggest how much bomb-grade material the DPRK has now or could straightforwardly produce based on initial materials estimates.

Examination of missile and bomb technology will include both weapon miniaturization (the process by which nuclear warheads can be made small enough to fit on a missile) and the status of the DPRK's missile program. The outcomes of recent missile and nuclear tests will be examined, and expert analysis on the magnitude of explosions, level of advancement of rockets, etc. will be considered. 

In conjunction, this information reveals a great deal about North Korea's position in nuclear negotiations. "Breakout time", or the amount of time necessary to produce a bomb's worth of weapons-grade nuclear material, was a critical discussion point in Iranian nuclear negotiations. It seems likely, therefore, that the speed with which the DPRK could credibly produce a weapon might impact how the US negotiates with them - the easier it is for North Korea to make a bomb, the more difficult the process of convincing them to give up the technology may become - and the more urgent the problem becomes. Additionally, as the amount of work that stands between the DPRK and the ability to threaten nuclear strikes on distant capitals decreases, a similar calculus occurs.

\subsection{Rhetorical Analysis}
The development of the escalatory cycles model in the historical section forms the starting point of rhetorical analysis. As the relationship between the DPRK and the US shifts through rising and falling tensions, it is expected that the rhetoric used by official outlets on either side will shift commensurately. Also, looking at public statements in conjunction with historical data is worthwhile for determining when position statements are followed by action, versus when they turn out to be empty promises.

Initial rhetorical examination will focus on the evolution of rhetoric over time - for example, the phrases used by official North Korean news agencies to describe political adversaries, or the terms US officials emphasize when discussing previous agreements. These are valuable indicators of general attitude, and when taken in conjunction with the outcomes of the associated negotiating efforts, can suggest correlations between various rhetorical tendencies and the prospects of success for diplomatic efforts. This work will draw on previous efforts by Rich \cite{rich12, rich14} and others. \todo{maybe get more cites?}
