What did NK want? what DOES it want? why the shift?
	denuclearize agreement/AF --> did want to deal (why? econ weakness?)
	collapse of AF
		most agree Bush wanted it to fail (found excuses for delay, "tit-for-tat noncompliance"
		talk about changes over administrations on both sides
	Current
		NK not favorable to talking
		ALTHOUGH leap day agreement DID happen
		what do they want now?

So maybe new section - informed by history + rhetoric + more sources
	What was position in (il+clinton) --> 1994
	what about (il+bush) --> collapse of AF
	(il+obama)
	(un+obama) --> leap day, collapse + present

Look into:
	David Straub (Stanford)
	Chris Nelson
	CRS overviews
