rich 14 suggests:
-references of US in KCNA correlate really strongly with references to nuclear program (US references hit near the middle of 6pt countries in terms of daily frequency and at the bottom in terms of number of references, but correlate more strongly with nuclear than any of the others)
-in terms of rhetoric, there is no significant change in nuclear posturing based on political regimes - specifically, whether there are liberal or conservative politicians in charge of the US and SK, KCNA's rhetoric doesn't seem to vary specifically because of that
-however, general increase in references over time - this is probably not a sign of DPRK trying to leverage new leadership in each country to start over, b/c general trend of nuclear tech is also increasing over time (? this is my conclusion not his)
-ramping-up of mentions as a nuclear test approaches is followed by a cooling-down for some time - rich theorizes they have demonstrated "an ability to defy international condemnation of their program" and therefore no longer feel the need for aggressive rhetoric

rich 12 sez:
-references to the US are really low. like, barely above mexico and far less than any other 6pt country.
-on the other hand, "An increase in references to the United States, holding all else constant, is the largest predictor of additional references to nuclear issues."
-this research was done on the year in which yeonpyong and cheonon happened
-when Incidents that aren't nuclear in nature occur, references to nuclear go down - suspicion that they're trying to separate current Incidents from long-running nuclear ambition
-while DPRK tries to frame many issues as simple disputes between them and ROK, they try to frame nuclear issues as US-DPRK bilateral, suggesting bilateral talks are desired over multilat

-says nationalism is far and away the biggest category (of "US, deterrence, international, and nationalism") in terms of mentions immediately before and after major incidents - with some exceptions, at which US is predominant
-also, though, nationalism is the highest category across the board, so it's unclear whether this is a differentially relevant thing or just "they're really nationalist all the time"

-US policy frames DPRK as irrational, cause of all problems, eeeeeeevil
-"The rhetoric of rogue states is indicative of how USforeign policy continues to be driven by dualistic and militaristic Cold Warthinking patterns. The ‘Evil Empire’ may be gone; not so the underlying needto define safety and security with reference to an external threat that must bewarded off at any cost"
-during Bush administration, preemptive strike policy against "rogue states" reinforced implicit/explicit threat posed by US to DPRK
	-US policy obscures the result of this by blaming DPRK for problems
-case study: foreign policy during the 1994 crisis by the US framed DPRK as rogue state, discouraged mutual cooperation, fostered recalcitrance
-in 1998 the Perry Report comes out, suggesting a still-aggressive but more "integrated" policy (read this report later if available?) "Tn this respect the Perry Report signified a remarkable departure fromthe US position of viewing rogue states as inherently evil, irrational andincapable of compromising."
-US "axis of evil" speech, publication of nuclear strategy explicitly mentioning possible first-use of nukes against rogue states, including DPRK
-"Severalscholars, most notably Bruce Cumings and Hazel Smith, have for years drawnattention to Washington’s inability to see North Korea as anything but a dangerousand unpredictable rogue state"
-simultaneous propagation of "we want to have discussion! confidence-building! dialogue!" but also "DPRK is evil! all military options are still on the table!"
-Re: the Kelly negotiations in 2002: "‘These were not negotiations,’ stressed one of them. ‘Kelly immediately startedwith accusations." (Cited in Henrik Bork, ‘Annäherungen auf Umwegen’, Süddeutsche Zeitung, 11 Jan. 2003, p. 2. Author’stranslation., via this article)
