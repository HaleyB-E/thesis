rich 14 suggests:
-references of US in KCNA correlate really strongly with references to nuclear program (US references hit near the middle of 6pt countries in terms of daily frequency and at the bottom in terms of number of references, but correlate more strongly with nuclear than any of the others)
-in terms of rhetoric, there is no significant change in nuclear posturing based on political regimes - specifically, whether there are liberal or conservative politicians in charge of the US and SK, KCNA's rhetoric doesn't seem to vary specifically because of that
-however, general increase in references over time - this is probably not a sign of DPRK trying to leverage new leadership in each country to start over, b/c general trend of nuclear tech is also increasing over time (? this is my conclusion not his)
-ramping-up of mentions as a nuclear test approaches is followed by a cooling-down for some time - rich theorizes they have demonstrated "an ability to defy international condemnation of their program" and therefore no longer feel the need for aggressive rhetoric
